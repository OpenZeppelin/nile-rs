## Overview

Nile is a CLI tool to develop or interact with StarkNet projects written in Cairo. This is an ongoing effort to migrate the existing tool written in Python to Rust, for compatibility with the new Cairo1 compiler.

## Feature parity

For the current status of the features migration from Python check [this page](https://github.com/ericnordelo/nile-rs/blob/main/docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md).

## Testing features

While we have the intention to release to [crates.io](https://crates.io) as soon as the [cairo crates](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/main/crates) get released, in the meantime, you can try cloning this repository and checking the currently available features from the `main` branch running:

```
cargo run -- --help
```
