## Developing

### Set up

This is similar than other Rust projects, with the difference that you must run test on a single thread with `cargo stest`.

```
git clone https://github.com/ericnordelo/nile-rs
```
```
cd nile-rs
```
```
cargo stest
```

Make sure there's no devnet node up when running the test suite, because this will make some tests fail.

### Useful Commands

- Build and run release version:

  ```shell
  cargo build --release && cargo run --release
  ```

- Run Clippy:

  ```shell
  cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Run all tests:

  ```shell
  cargo stest
  ```

- Check to see if there are code formatting issues

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  ```

- Format the code in the project

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all
  ```
